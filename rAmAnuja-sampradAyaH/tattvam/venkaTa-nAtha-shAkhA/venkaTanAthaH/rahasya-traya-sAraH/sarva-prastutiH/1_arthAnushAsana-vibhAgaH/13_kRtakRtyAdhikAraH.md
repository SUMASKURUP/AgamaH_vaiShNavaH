When Bhagavān, who is omnipotent, who knows all things and who is, by His nature, full of love for us, has accepted the responsibility (of protecting us ), there is nothing more remaining to be done by us here for it; let us therefore fix our souls in that bundle of supreme bliss and feel the satisfaction (of having attained our object) by becoming rich in rendering service to Him, poor though we may have been before.

THE PRAPANNA HAS DONE WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO

AND HAS ATTAINED HIS GOAL:

(1) The man who has adopted this upāya (prapatti) has, from the time when he adopted it, nothing else to do for attaining the fruit thereof. (2) What he had to do has been done by performing prapatti once; (3) (Bhagavān) who is independent (of all others), whose will is irresistible and who is the one that rewards us with the fruit (of our actions) says, "Do not grieve ,"[Carama śloka] . Owing to these (three) reasons, the prapanna would become care-free at the thought of having surrendered his bhara. The Lord of all who has been accepted as the upāya*, which is ever present [Siddhopāya - the upāya which is ever present is Bhagavān, for He is always eager to save the jīva.] as stated in, "Seek refuge under me alone", has said "I will release Thee from all sins", and since the Lord can (always) be trusted and since He is capable (of acting according to His word), he would have no doubts or fears in regard to the realisation of his object. So he (the prapanna) would rejoice at having given up even the slightest trace of other aims or objects and also with having given up other upāyas along with upāyas which are subsidiary to them. Like a poor man who has received a great treasure with little effort, he would rejoice at the prospect of the supreme goal (of life ) which he is to attain. It has been said: "He who has sought, in every possible manner, the refuge of Nārāyaṇa  who is the Saviour and the guru of the world is not the servant of the gods, of the rishis, of animals, of men and of the pitṛs. He is in no way their debtor". In regard to such jīvas (kṣetrajnas) as have taken the names of Prajāpati (the Lord of creatures ) and Pasupati (the Lord of beasts, viz. bound souls), he is able, like one whose promissory note registered in the unwritten Vedas under certain conditions (upādhi relating to caste etc.) and requiring service as interest for the principal ( borrowed by him from them) has been fully discharged (torn off).

Therefore when he has to pronounce their names in the performance of *such compulsory and regularly recurrent and occasional rites as the five great yajnas (pañcamaha yajnas), he would realise that these names refer really to Iśvara (Bhagavān) etymologically: as has been stated by the sages in passages like :-" Those who worship the pitṛs (the spirits of their fore-fathers), the gods, the Brahmins and Agni - they (in reality) worship only Viṣṇu , who is the Inner Self of all beings." When the king's servants place a garland and a jewel on the coat worn by the king, their object is not to please the coat but to gain the favour of the king.

The same idea has been expressed in such places as the chapter called Yajnagrahara in the Mahābhārata   (Ch. 349 Śānti Parva:"The Great Padmanabha receives the quintessences of all the offerings made in sacrifices" and when the gods asked Brahma who was performing a sacrifice to Bhagavān he replied: "Neither by me nor by any one else who wants to cross the sea of saṁsāra are you adored with sacrifices. It is only Bhagavān who receives our offerings”)[The idea is that Prajāpati, Pasupati. Agni and others are only like the coat of a king and that, within them, there is the Inner Ruler, Immortal, who alone is Parameśvara or the Supreme Ruler.] and in Hastigiri Māhātmya. In the Brahma Sūtras also (1-2-29), it is said : "Since words like Agni refer directly also to Brahman, Jaimini is of the opinion that there is nothing unreasonable in it". Such words as gods and pitṛs have no connection with the coats called gods and pitṛs and by the full significance contained in their parts (i.e.) etymology or derivation, they stand for Iśvara (Bhagavān), in the same way as words like Nārāyaṇa  do. In pronouncing such words (Prajāpati, Pasupati, Agni), the prapanna would realise that there is no violation of his sole and exclusive devotion to Bhagavān, in the same way as, when the pure Sacrificers (s'uddhayaji) who live in Swetadvipa pronounce the word Nārāyaṇa  (Nārānam ayanam), they do not go against their exclusive devotion to Bhagavān by using the word Nāra. Bhagavān has willed to accept him as His servant to render service in accordance with his varṇa, āśrama, occasions (like the birth of a child) and qualities (like being a Vaiṣṇava). Therefore by service to Him who is the Ruler and the śeṣī-service which consists in obedient performance of His commands and permissions as understood from the Śāstras, the prapanna would do his little bit of service like the freed souls who understand the mind of the Lord by direct perception and be like the muktas; he would be extolled, according to the śāstra s and those who stand by them, as one who, by the completion of the upāya (prapatti), has done his duty and who, by the completion of his aim in life, has attained satisfaction.

Śrī Rāmānuja has conclusively described the prapanna's reflection on his satisfactory fulfilment of his duty thus in his Śaraṇāgati Gadya :-"Therefore rest happy in the assurance free from all doubt that you will know me, see me, and attain me As I truly am". This is what it means:-"We were wandering in saṁsāra owing to Bhagavān's punishment inflicted on us for transgressing His commands from beginningless time. By the compassion of Bhagavān ever waiting for an opportunity (to save us), we came into the reach of the kind glances of our good ācārya s and by repeating after them their utterance of Dvaya, we have completed our prapatti. There is no further means needed for obtaining the Saviour. Therefore He will pardon (all the sins) which were the cause of the punishment. The Lord of Śrī(Lakṣmī ) who is the śeṣī  of all and who is capable of purifying His devotees and obtaining their service, will, for His own glory, protect us. With this faith, the prapanna would be free from all care or anxiety or responsibility." (This is the purport of ŚrīRāmānuja's words in the Gadya). This idea is the conclusive meaning which is surely contained also in the Saviour's words "Do not grieve" (in the carama śloka).

THE MARKS OF ONE WHO HAS PERFORMED

PRAPATTI :

Since one of the qualifications for the performance of prapatti, is sorrow or grief before prapatti, if he had no grief before, he would not have the necessary qualification for performing prapatti. So by the principle "when there is no cause, there is no effect," his upāya (prapatti) will not be effective. If, after the performance of prapatti, he grieves owing to want of faith in the words of the Saviour, it would follow by the principle "When the effect is absent, there must have been absence of all the required materials (or causes)" that his upāya is incomplete (owing to want of full faith) and that the benefit or fruit will be delayed inasmuch as it will require the completion of the upāya. The man who was formerly full of grief and who is now free from sorrow in accordance with the words" Do not grieve" may be considered to have done what should be done (i.e.) prapatti in the proper manner,

Our spiritual leaders whom the Lord of Śrī that dwells on Hastigiri has taken into His protection after endeavouring for a long time to find out what boon He should confer on those who loved Him. They are like kings and gods (to us), for they have, ever in their minds, the abode of the Lord of the eternal suris and they are like Paramahamsas, because they have completed all rites that have to be performed, (or like swans in their purity or in their capacity to separate the essential from the non-essential).

Bharanyāsa (or the surrender of the responsibility of protection) has been made (at the feet of) Bhagavān (Hari) for reaching beyond saṁsāra. So also actions that can produce only limited pleasures have been given up just like forbidden actions. The sustenance of the body will continue in accordance with past karma (which has begun to operate). So nothing needs to be done for it. Thereafter (i.e) after prapatti the bounds[^54] * imposed by the Lord's command are scrupulously observed by wise men, (merely because it is the Lord's command.)

[^54]: This means that the nitya and naimittika karmas which are ordained by the Lord in the śāstra s have still to be performed after prapatti, as, otherwise, there would be transgression of His command.
