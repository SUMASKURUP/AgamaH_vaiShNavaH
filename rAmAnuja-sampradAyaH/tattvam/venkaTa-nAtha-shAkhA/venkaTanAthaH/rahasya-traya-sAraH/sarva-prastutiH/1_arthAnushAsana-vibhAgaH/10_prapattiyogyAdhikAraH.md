Fitness (for Bhakti or Prapatti) consists in a combination of desire (for the fruits of a course of action and of ability which is threefold[^50] . This fitness of man is differentiated as consisting in conditions prescribed for the yoga of eight aṅgas or auxiliaries (bhakti yoga) and for the yoga of six aṅgas or auxiliaries (prapatti). That Bhagavān is the refuge or Saviour of all has been declared in the śruti  and confirmed in the smṛtis। In adopting this righteous path viz., prapatti, there is competence for all as in the matter of speaking the truth and such other injunctions as are ordained in the Vedas (for all men , without any difference of caste or āśrama).

[^50]: 1: Ability which is threefold - The ability to understand the meaning of śāstra s: the ability to perform what is ordained in them and the competence as laid down in the śāstra s according to caste, qualities and the like.

(Those who are not of the three higher castes are prohibited from the performance of certain rites and duties ordained in the śruti s, but this prohibition does not apply to such injunctions as "speak the truth ", and " look upon your mother as divine" etc. which are also ordained in the Vedas. So also prapatti, though prescribed in the Vedas, is open to all castes ).

010 2:- Bhakti Yoga: Bhakti Yoga is called the aṣṭāṅga yoga, because its eight aṅgas are yama, niyama, etc. Prapatti is called ṣaḍaṅga yoga, because its six aṅgas are such as anukulya saṅkalpa, prathikulya varjanam, mahāviśvāsam, ākiñcanyam, etc., to be described later,

THE MEANING OF COMPETENCY OR ADHIKĀRA:

It is necessary that one should know the special qualifications and the like required in a person who intends to adopt nyāsa vidyā (prapatti) without any desire for the other upāyas in the quest for the goal that is desired. Competency (adhikāra ) consists in

the attribute of desiring the end on the part of the person who adopts an upāya for the sake of a certain desired result and also ability to adopt it. Ability means the capacity to understand the meaning of the śāstras and the capacity to perform what is ordained therein and, likewise, fitness or competency in accordance with what is prescribed in the śāstras, such as, caste, quality and the like (āchāra - samskāra). This competency exists already (before the adoption of the upāya). To the man who has this competency, what is stated to be the object to be obtained by the means, is the desired result or fruit. Upāya is the means prescribed or ordained for securing that fruit or result. The person who has become desirous of mukti (mumukṣu) and who adopts the special upāya for mokṣa  called direct and independent prapatti should have, in common with the upāsaka ( who has adopted bhakti), a knowledge obtained from the Śāstras of such things as the relationship (between Jīvātmā and Paramatma as that between the body and the soul) and he should have in addition, the special qualifications of ākiñcanya and ananyagatitva ; ākiñcanya means the absence (in a person) of the ability for other upāyas. Ananyagatitvam means an aversion to all other interests (than mokṣa) and a turning away from all other refuge than Bhagavān. The latter is implicit in the former, namely, aversion to all other interests. This may be seen from such passages as the following :-"Wise men never worship Brahma, Rudra and others who are called gods, for the boons that they could grant are limited."

If, without an eager and impatient desire for immediate mokṣa, a person who wants such things as the continuance of the body (or the continuance of the worship of arcāvatāra) adopts prapatti for the sake of mokṣa , his mukti will be delayed in proportion to these other interests,

ĀKINCHANYA AND ANANYAGATITVA:

Ākiñcanya and ananyagatitva are conditioned by the ignorance of and inability to adopt other upāyas on the part of the person adopting this means, as also his inability to endure delay in attaining mukti. His turning away from other saviours than Bhagavān is conditioned by his conviction of the absolute dependence on Bhagavān alone, which is common to himself and to others (including other deities than the Lord), as is stated in the śloka : “ Just as, O 'Bharata, tips of grass are entirely subject to (the force of) the wind, even so are all beings subject to the sway of the Lord ", and it is conditioned also by his aversion to other interests than mukti,

THE PRAMĀṆAS IN SUPPORT :

The nature of the specific competency for prapatti is evident from the following authoritative passages and from spiritual tradition : "Having been abandoned by his own father (Indra), the gods and the great sages, he, (i.e.) Kakasura, wandered about the three worlds and finally took refuge under Rāma alone", "I am the abode of all transgressions; I have no means or upāya to save myself and I have nothing else to attain besides Thee"; "I seek" the refuge of Thy feet, O Śaraṇya (Saviour): I have no other upāya and nothing else to attain than Thee": "*Finding that there is no upāya for leaping over saṁsāra even in all the endless future, etc." : "I, who am aware that there is no upāya for me in all the thousands of crores of kalpas other than performing prapatti at Thy two lotus-like feet", and, “I who have no other refuge and no other saviour etc."

PRAPATTI IS OPEN TO ALL:

If such qualifications exist, prapatti is certainly open to all as an upāya, since there are no restrictions to it such as caste.

The devotees of the Lord ( ācārya s) have themselves understood and have made us (also ) understand the eternal Lord who is the origin of all things and who is anxious to save us, being full of the might of mercy, so that all persons from the Brahmin to the Caṇḍāla and especially those who feel most the sufferings of saṁsāra may, in their helplessness and without seeking any other saviour or any other fruit, approach Him and seek refuge under Him.

(1) Inability to adopt such upāyas as Bhakti yoga, (2) ignorance of the required knowledge; (3) prohibition by the śāstras of the adoption of such means and (4) inability to endure any delay in attaining mukti :- these four, occurring either singly[^51] * or in combinations of two, three or four, by virtue of adṛṣṭa (resulting from meritorious deeds performed in the past) are qualifications of varied kinds for the performance of direct and independent prapatti to the Lord of Lakṣmī  and good men resort to it with these qualifications and free from all doubt for the attainment of mukti.

[^51]: Those who have only one of these four are of four classes, those who have any two of them are of six, those who have any three are of four and those who have all the four form one.
